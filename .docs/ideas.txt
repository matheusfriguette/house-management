✨ Additional App Feature Ideas
1. Price Tracking Over Time
Track changes in the price of favorite items over time (requires a cron job + scraping or third-party API).

Alert user if price drops.

2. Collaborative Mode
Allow multiple users to access/edit the same house setup (e.g., couples moving in).

Real-time updates or change tracking (e.g., “John added ‘Microwave’ to Kitchen”).

3. Budget & Spending Goals
Let users set a budget per room or total.

Show if they’re above, below, or on track.

4. Notes & To-Dos per Room
Example: “Paint walls before buying shelves”

Could be tied to item priorities or standalone.

5. Filter & Sort Options in Item View
Filter by: Purchased, Priority, Cheapest Option, Category (if you add it)

Sort items by: Price, Priority, Added Date

6. Printable or Shareable Checklist
Export room/item list as a printable or shareable checklist (PDF or link)

7. Room Templates
Predefined room types with common starter items (e.g. Kitchen → Plates, Microwave, Fridge).

8. Mobile-first Design Considerations
Make the dashboard visually engaging on mobile — swipeable cards for rooms, bottom sheet for filters, etc.
